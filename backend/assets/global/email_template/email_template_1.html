        Our underwriting team is working diligently to review your application. In some cases, you might receive an
        instant approval. However, it's common for us to request additional documents or information about your business
        to ensure everything is in order. This is a normal part of the process, so please keep an eye on your texts and
        emails for any updates from us.
