        Unlike other payment processors that provide borrowed access to their merchant account, we believe in giving you
        full control and ownership of your merchant account. Why does this matter? Because it puts you in the driver's
        seat, giving you the autonomy to manage your payments and business operations with confidence.

        As you may know, part of the process of setting up your merchant account involves underwriting. While this step
        may seem daunting, it's actually a crucial part of ensuring the security and integrity of your account. Our
        underwriting process helps us understand your business better, identify any potential risks, and tailor our
        services to meet your specific needs.

        You should be close to completing your underwriting and approval at this point. If you haven't received approval
        yet, don't worry – just reach out to your dedicated onboarding specialist for assistance. They're here to guide
        you through the process and ensure that everything goes smoothly.
